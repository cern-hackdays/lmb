						<p class="question">Why did you come to the CERN line-mode browser development days?</p>
						<p>I'm here to help create an interface that helps people understand what the early web browsing experience was like.</p>
						
						<p class="question">Why would you want to do that?</p>
						<p>Twenty years ago, using and programming the web was a completely different experience from what 
							it is today. Because I was using the web then, I remember what browsing with the line-mode browser was 
							like. I remember writing code for it, and it looked a lot like the code we're digging through today.</p>
						<p>These days, I spend a fair amount of time teaching students and coaching younger web developers -- I 
							love working with people who are fairly new to the web. It's important for aspiring web professionals 
							to understand that experience and that history, in order to understand the web’s origins and how far we've 
							gotten in a short period of time. I also think there's real value in understanding what mistakes were made 
							in the past -- features left unfinished or functionality not clearly defined -- so that we don't repeat them 
							in the future. </p>
						<p>This project serves as a good reminder that there are people who still have a text-based browsing 
							experience. There are so many mobile phones that still only get a text-only experience, because they're 
							not smart phones. And, of course, what some assistive devices render is more akin to a text-based experience.</p>
							
						<p class="question">Let's go back to that early experience of the text-only browser environment. What was that like when you first started?</p>
						<p>The first webpage that I ever made was really done with and for the Mosaic browser, while I was at my 
							college’s computing lab. Back in my dorm room, all I had a dial-up connection to our Unix mail server. 
							There I could only run Lynx, a text-only browser. Outside the computer lab, everything I did was text-only. </p>

						<p>I grew very accustomed to the difference between the two browsers. It forced you to think about your content as being separate from 
						the presentation – it reinforced the idea that the purpose of the web was communicating content. A few of us who are here for the hack 
						days are still evangelizing the separation of presentation from content, it’s that important of a concept and it’s still often ignored.</p>
						 
						<p  class="question">What are you hoping to get out of the next two days?</p>
						<p>I'm very interested in ensuring we can visually render a modern-day web page such that it looks as it would have in the old line-mode browser, to demonstrate that the basic instruction set of the web still functions today, and that we ensure it keeps on working. I’m also hoping to create a parser that will allow people to input a URL and get back code that looks like what they might have written 20 years ago: strip out everything modern-day and take it back to the bare bones. To say to developers, "No matter how beautiful you think your code is today, this is what 
							it would have looked like 20 years ago," and hopefully pique their interest in understanding HTML’s origins, and the web’s origins.</p>
						
						<p class="question">Anything else you'd like to add?</p>	
						<p>I'm so honored, and so excited, to be here. This is a complete dream! I have realized that not all web 
							professionals know that CERN is the birthplace of the web, so I think we’re educating many people by being 
							here. Personally, I know many people who applied to come to the hack days, and I realize they are living 
							vicariously through me for the next couple of days, so I'm posting to social media as much as I can!</p>
						<p>Also, I wouldn’t be here had it not been for the encouragement and support of a number of 
							important people from my college days. I have to thank my friend, Sarah, for first showing me 
							how to write HTML, and I have to thank the staff at Bryn Mawr College (including Elysa, Helen, John, 
							Rodney, David, Jeb, Alisa, and Jennifer) for giving me a running start. But, most of all, I have to 
							thank my college advisor and friend, Deepak Kumar, who helped me find my first “real” web development job, 
							and reinforced that what I loved doing -- creating web sites -- could become a viable career, before most 
							people even knew what the web was.</p>

						<p class="question">Why did you come to the CERN line-mode browser development days?</p>
						<p>The main reason is because I think it's important. We're highlighting that digital stuff can die and go away, 
							and that isn't okay. The first website and the method of browsing the first website died 20 years ago. 
							We want to make sure we can bring that back so people can see how the web was browsed in the days that it was 
							first created. And that's pretty special I think.</p>
						
						<p class="question">Is there an attitude that it is okay for things to die online?</p>
						<p>Unfortunately there's a history of that. You remember GeoCities? Whole communities that have been 
							there years are lost forever. Maybe it comes down to the fact that – you know, the content doesn't rot, 
							we can't put it in a landfill. There's no material cost. It's just pixels, and pixels cost nothing to 
							create. So people have the attitude that it doesn't matter if they die.</p>

						<p class="question">But surely once you have a URL it's there forever right?</p>
						<p>Well, that's not the case unfortunately. You can have a URL, but then URLs stop working. Just a few days ago quite a well-known magazine in the UK closed its website. All the URLS for all the articles fro the past 4-5 years are dead. Gone. If you wanted to find an article on that site now, you can't. And that's a problem. I know it takes time and money and effort to keep URLs alive sometimes. But some URLS should never have gone away. Like the first website. Because that is history.</p>
						
						<p  class="question">What are you focusing on in these two days?</p>
						<p>I'm recreating the typeface. We have a test IBM terminal with the line-mode browser running and we've done some research into the typeface. We can't get it off the machine because it's probably hardware encoded. It's a typeface similar to Courier, but it's not Courier.</p>
						
						<p class="question">So the typeface is lost in the machine?</p>	
						<p>Well, no. We can't quite work it out. We think the machine renders the typeface. It's not a file that runs on 
 system like we use fonts now. It's maybe hardcoded into the display. So the computer just gives the display a message "display this character" 
 and it's hardware encoded into the monitor to display that character.</p>
 
<p>So to simulate the typeface, we've just taken really close up photographs of the screen and then recreated them in a bitmap 
	format. There's a very limited character set – you don't really need too many letters.</p>
	
						<p class="question">What would you like people to take away from the experience of using the line-mode browser?</p>
 
<p>I'd like people to take away how far we've come but also to take away an understanding of how revolutionary the web was when it 
first appeared. It was a pretty special moment when the web came about.</p>

						<p class="question">Why did you come to the CERN line-mode browser development days?</p>
						<p>I've come to help in the project for the restoration of the first website at CERN.</p>
						
						<p class="question">Why is the project important?</p>
						<p>The web is important in our lives today. But we seem to forget where it all started. It's important for us to 
							bring it all together for people who never had the experience of the web in the first days.</p>

						<p class="question">Do you remember your first experience of using the web?</p>
 
						<p>Yes, I remember: It was in 2001. Connectivity in Kenya is a more recent thing compared to Europe. 
							I went for classes – internet and computing classes. We visited the normal sites such as Yahoo, we 
							created email accounts, and some small searches. I think it was AltaVista we used. Back in the day! I 
							think the first website I used was Askjeeves.com.</p>
 
						<p class="question">What are you focussing on in these two days?</p>	
 
						<p>I am on the side bringing the stories together about the first website, the early web and the digital 
							preservation effort. It's a really big honor for me to be here – I'm a big fan of CERN. I've read about it 
							in books and on websites. I actually participated in hackathons, Science hack day in Nairobi before, where 
							we used the data from one of the larger experiments here at CERN: CMS. So it's a dream for me to be here. </p>

					</div>
					<div class="qs-and-as">
						<p class="question">Why did you come to the CERN line-mode browser development days?</p>
						<p>Well, I see everything through the lens of publishing. The web is undeniably one of the most 
							important tools democratizing our ability to take a piece of text — an idea — push it out there 
							and have a tremendous audience with near universally accessible and relatively inexpensive resources on your end.</p>
						<p>If we go back to where that all began, there was, of course, Tim Berners-Lee and the NeXus browser but, really, the line-mode 
						browser was the democratization of that first bit that they built on the NeXT machines.</p>
						<p>I think it's inspiring and humbling. It's fascinating to see what this simple, really difficult to use, command-line interface 
						browser morphed into. How this thing that had such humble beginnings became the seed for how so much of publishing works today. 
						The way we think about text — the way we think about contemporary knowledge dissemination —  all began here with this project.
						</p>
						
						<p class="question">What do you think was the main change that the browser brought to the publishing world?</p>
						<p>I think it was the fact that this was a near universally accessible application. It was the first time that anyone who had a machine anywhere could download this piece of software and suddenly they could be publishing to a place that was theoretically accessible anywhere there was a computer and internet connection. And that piece of publishing had a real, public, open address. Obviously, 20 years ago the internet wasn't quite as pervasive – connections weren't quite as pervasive. 
							But this browser got everyone excited and helped to push the internet outside of academia and into our pockets all over the world.</p>
						
						<p  class="question">What are you hoping to achieve in these two days?</p>
						<p>I'm focussing on... Honestly, I'm just geeking out. I'm just happy to be here. It feels like a weird Mecca of sorts to come to if you work with the internet, if you work with the web. Especially considering I owe almost all of the work I do today and that I have done over the last 15 years to what was created here. It's just nice to have that historical context and to understand the energy of the place where everything that we use today was born.</p>
						
						<p class="question">Do you remember your first experience of the web?</p>
 
						<p>Yeah. I was using Prodigy – that wasn't technically the World Wide Web, it was a consumer 
							shell of the web. But I remember when I got my first UNIX shell account on a local ISP. I must have been 
							14 – back in 94 or 95. Opening links using a text based browser. There was a moment where you could – it was 
							super geeky – you could emulate a PPP socket, which allowed you on a Windows 95 machine to open up Mosaic, and 
							using a shell account, connect to the internet, to the World Wide Web. </p>

						<p>I remember the first time I fired up Mosaic, I was looking at a web pages and I thought immediately, 
							"Okay, this is worth investing in. This is worth giving my time to." </p>

						<p class="question">Why did you come to the CERN line-mode browser development days?</p>
 
						<p>I'm here to recreate the first web pages and the early web browsers. I'm here to be part of 
							something important for the web and for my profession as a web designer and developer.  </p>
 
						<p class="question">Why is recreating the line-mode browser important?</p>
 
						<p>It's important to remember, to recall where we came from and to retrace our paths from the beginning 
							right up till what the web is today. To be able to see how we evolved, how technology has evolved, and how 
							web design has evolved with it.</p>

						<p>I think we have lost a lot of things along the way. Losing information is a part of the process. 
							But I think that going back, as we are doing now, is like a cycle: we learn a lot, then we do things 
							badly again, so we have to go back again to keep learning.</p>
 
						<p class="question">What are you hoping to achieve in the next two days?</p>
 
						<p>I really hope to build something that will let us show people – and not just geeks but 'normal' 
							people too – that the web is really a wonderful, amazing thing. It's something they have to care for 
							and pay attention to. People use it every day but don't pay attention. Just think how many people work on 
							the web, and how much effort they put in.</p>
 
						<p class="question">What sparked your interest in the web at the beginning?</p>			
 
						<p>It's so long ago that I don't remember really. I started working on the web in 94. I came from 
							desktop publishing. In the web I found a flexible new way to create and produce documents and to design 
							layouts. So much more flexible than having something frozen in a page on paper.</p>

						<p class="question">Why did you come to the CERN line-mode browser development days?</p>
						<p>I've been playing around with the web for the last 15-20 years. It's something that always fascinated me. So the opportunity to come to CERN to where it all started, and help document and rebuild the original website is a fantastic opportunity. I just had to take the chance to come here.</p>

						<p class="question">Why do you think we should do this project? What's the point?</p>
						<p>I guess, with anything – it's like archaeology. There's a lot of history, and we're learning from our mistakes. We run the risk of forgetting the things we've done before, or looking at the history of where we came from and how we evolved and looking at the decisions that were made along the way.</p>
						<p>It's like some of the things we were talking about this morning. It's interesting to see people fighting for “Javascript in / Javascript out”; “Must be pure / Must be liberal in what they accept.” It's been super interesting. It's a story that a lot more people need to know about.</p>

						<p class="question">And of course a lot of those technical arguments continue to this day…</p>
						<p>Absolutely. As we see with progressive enhancement, sites are very heavily Javascript driven with the concept of web apps. Whereas the thing we're building today – the original line-mode browser – doesn't even understand Javascript at all, so these new sites would fail. It's really interesting – these debates are ongoing even 20 + years later.</p>

						<p  class="question">Are you finding it quite a technical challenge? What's your approach for rebuilding this simulator?</p>
						<p>That's what we're trying to figure out. It's still day one and we're looking at trying to have a nice balance between some authenticity (to make it actually as authentic as the original) but also keep the longevity around, so this is something that people will be able to run 5 or 10 years. The line mode browser is quite difficult to run as it is, so we want something that's going to be a little more future proof. That will affect how we actually build this. We want to try and make it as authentic an experience as it was 20 years ago.</p>
						
						<p class="question">What was your first experience of the web like?</p>	
						<p>I use Internet Explorer 4 or 5 on a dial-up modem. I can still remember the beeps and whistles it made, and I was so happy when I upgraded it to 28.8. I had to dial up to a local service provider. The first time I ever discovered the web, a friend's father was working at a local university so he had access early on. And I was bitten.</p>
						<p>I always say it's a bit like photography. There's a really nice design aesthetic, sort of front-end development, and then there's really big coding side. With photography you've got the "arts" bit, but you also have the technical bits of the camera. The web and HTML is a really nice balance between both of those.</p>
