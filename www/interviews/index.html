						<p class="question">Why did you come to the CERN line-mode browser development days?</p>
						<p>I've been playing around with the web for the last 15-20 years. It's something that always fascinated me. So the opportunity 
							to come to CERN to where it all started, 
							and help document and rebuild the original website is a fantastic opportunity. I just had to take the chance to come here.</p>
							
						<p class="question">Why do you think we should do this project? What's the point?</p>
						<p>I guess, with anything – it's like archaeology. There's a lot of history, and we're learning from our mistakes. 
							We run the risk of forgetting the things we've done before, or looking at the history of where we came from and 
							how we evolved and looking at the decisions that were made along the way.</p>
							<p>It's like some of the things we were talking about this morning. It's interesting to see people 
								fighting for "Javascript in / Javascript out"; "Must be pure / Must be liberal in what they accept." 
								It's been super interesting. It's a story that a lot more people need to know about.</p>
								
						<p class="question">And of course a lot of those technical arguments continue to this day…</p>
						<p>Absolutely. As we see with progressive enhancement, sites are very heavily Javascript driven with the concept of web apps. 
							Whereas the thing we're building today – the original line-mode browser – doesn't 
							even understand Javascript at all, so these new sites would fail. It's really interesting – 
							these debates are ongoing even 20 + years later.</p>
							
						<p  class="question">Are you finding it quite a technical challenge? What's your approach for rebuilding this simulator?</p>
						<p>That's what we're trying to figure out. It's still day one and we're looking at trying to have a nice balance 
							between some authenticity (to make it actually as authentic as the original) but also keep the longevity around, 
							so this is something that people will be able to run 5 or 10 years. The line mode browser is quite difficult to run as 
							it is, so we want something that's going to be a little more future proof. That will affect how we actually build this. 
							We want to try and make it as authentic an experience as it was 20 years ago.</p>
							
						<p class="question">What was your first experience of the web like?</p>	
						<p>I use Internet Explorer 4 or 5 on a dial-up modem. I can still remember the beeps and whistles it made, and I 
							was so happy when I upgraded it to 28.8. I had to dial up to a local service provider. The first time I ever discovered 
							the web, a friend's father was working at a local university so he had access early on. And I was bitten.</p>
 
<p>I always say it's a bit like photography. There's a really nice design aesthetic, sort of front-end development, and then there's really big coding 
side. With photography you've got the "arts" bit, but you also have the technical bits of the camera. The web and HTML is a really nice balance 
between both of those.
