							<p class="standfirst">The Line Mode Browser was not the world’s first web browser. The very first web browser was called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb">WorldWideWeb</a> and was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="d2">
						<p>But WorldWideWeb only worked on the NexT operating system. WorldWideWeb was a great piece of software, but it was important that the web should be accessible to many kinds of computers, not just NexT machines.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="d-all">
						<p>That’s where the Line Mode Browser came in. It was the first web browser with a cross-platform codebase so it could be installed on many different kinds of computers. It was a relatively simple piece of software with a very basic interface, but in the early days of the web, it was instrumental in demonstrating the power of this new medium.</p>

						<h3>You’ve come a long way, browser</h3>
						<p>Web browsers today are quite powerful. They can run on all sorts of devices and display all kinds of content from plain text to images and video—you can even play games in modern web browsers.</p>
						<p>It wasn’t always this way. The Line Mode Browser could only display text. You could even use a mouse to click on links—you had to type in everything using a keyboard …even if you just wanted to follow a link!</p>
						<p>It sounds like a clunky experience (it was!) but wouldn’t you like to get a feeling of what it was like to browse the web back then? Well, thanks to the power of modern web browsers, you can.</p>

						<h3>Line Mode?</h3>
						<p>The first browser, built by Tim Berners-Lee on a NeXT computer, was really quite sophisticated; it was also beyond the capabilities of most of the computers in use at the time.</p>
						
						<p>The first browser needed to impress: it had get people to champion the WWW project, it had to hint at how powerful and useful the web could become. It had graphical capabilities, users would follow links by pointing to them with a mouse - then still a relatively new input device - and it even had a contributor mode where users could create and link content together right from the browser.</p>
						
						<p>The NeXT computer and its advanced graphical interface was the perfect machine on which to build the prototype browser that would impress an audience new to the web. But it was also very different from the computers that most people used at the time. In order to get WWW to be widely adopted, the team at CERN needed to develop a much simpler browser that could work with a wide variety of computers and terminals, some of them rather basic.</p>

						<p>They hired a young student called Nicola Pellow to write such a browser. It was so simple that a terminal with a screen only capable of showing 24 rows of 80 characters, and with no mouse, could run it. It was called the line-mode browser.</p>
