<H1>Porting to a new machine</H1>Read this secion if the browser has not already been ported to a binary-compatible
machine.We assume you have a unix-like environment, including some
sort of C (either Kernigan and Ritchie or ANSI) compiler, and a socket
library supporting TCP/IP communications.  The browser has been ported
to many systems, and so you should not have much trouble with a new
one.
<UL>
<LI>Make a new subdirectory under WWW/LineMode/Implementation for your
combination of machine and operating system. 
<LI>Copy the Makefile from another (similar) machine's subdirectory.
<LI>Modify the Makefile as necessary to compile and install on your system.
This involves selecting the compiler command, flags, etc, to be used,
and specifying directory names. See the file Implementation/CommonMakefile
which is included in the Makefile. Type  "make" to generate an executable
file.
<LI>Mail the Makefile, and any other changes you found were necessary,
back to us for the use of others. This is <A NAME=1 HREF=http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/Copyright.html>mandatory</A>
</UL>Now <A NAME=2 HREF=Installation.html#8>install the software</A> . _________________________________________________________________
