							<p class="question">Why did you come to the CERN line-mode browser hack
								days?</p>
							<p>I was invited to come a few months ago and I immediately jumped in. I
								thought it was a fantastic idea and I wanted to be a part of it. Plus, I
								was incredibly excited at the prospect of visiting CERN, the place where
								the web was born, as well as some of the most significant physics
								experiments of our century.</p>
							<p class="question">What got you interested in the early history of the
								web?</p>
							<p>I’m always interested in the history of everything I work with or
								like. Unfortunately, I never got the chance to use the web back then so
								all I knew about it came from texts and screenshots. Being able to
								actually use it and experience how it felt is a whole different
								experience and it’s almost humbling. I'm glad we were able to offer that
								to the rest of the world.</p>
							<p class="question">What part of recreating the line-mode browser did you
								focus on during the two days at CERN?</p>
							<p>Since my primary expertise is CSS, I focused a lot on the CSS used to
								render websites in a way that simulates how they’d have looked back
								then. I also wrote some of the client-side JS and helped answer
								questions about those and to make decisions about the way we’d implement
								the project. Although I didn’t focus on that at all, I loved how I was
								able to work with Node a wee bit, it’s something I always wanted to do
								and never got around to.</p>
							<p class="question">What do you want people to take away from the
								experience of using the line-mode browser?</p>
							<p>That “Rome wasn’t built in a day”. Every significant human
								breakthrough, from cars to the web, starts simple and evolves through
								multiple smaller steps by multiple different visionaries. Contrary to
								popular belief, innovation is more often evolution than revolution.
								Experiencing the web in its infancy gives us unique insight in the way
								this evolution works, which might even inspire more innovation.</p>
							<p>On a slightly unrelated note, I’m also hoping other people will share
								our fascination for digging into the archaeology of the web and will
								contribute to the Github repo so that this can eventually evolve as
								well, into a closer simulation of the original line mode browser.</p>
							<p class="question">Anything else you'd like to add?</p>
							<p>I had tons of fun these two days so I’d like to thank everybody
								involved in organizing this. I felt creative and I worked with some
								brilliant folks. We got to work on an exciting educational project that
								will hopefully enlighten many people about the humble beginnings of the
								web. At first I was worried it would be hard to work together with so
								many people on the same thing, at the same time, and still manage to be
								productive. However, it somehow worked incredibly well and the project
								was in high gear most of the time! Of course, we wouldn’t be able to
								have done it without good version control, so this taught me to love git
								even more.</p>

							<p class="question">Why did you come to the CERN line-mode browser hack
								days?</p>
							<p>Well, mostly to play at CERN! And the history of it: getting to play
								with code in really tight constraints – trying to replicate something
								that's tucked away and not really used anymore. It's just cool that the
								people who gave us the web as it is today were there 20 years ago doing
								sort of what we're doing today. And of course a couple of days hacking
								is always fun!</p>
							<p class="question">What was your focus during the hack days?</p>
							<p>My role was the coding part. I have a lot of experience writing
								Javascript-based applications. I could see how Javascript could solve a
								lot of the problems to replicate this old browser. So I worked on the
								back end server that allows you to visit any other website and get it
								into the line-mode browser.</p>
							<p>I also worked on some of the effects in the line-mode browser. We're
								quite pleased with the cursor rendering on the screen replicating the
								old terminal. Using new technology to be able to do that, and tricking
								the browser into thinking it's doing that.</p>
							<p class="question">Did any parts of the hack jump out as particularly
								challenging?</p>
							<p>The way I think of it is like this: Today's society is all
								automatic-focus cameras. And the expensive ones are the old,
								manual-focus cameras that you had all this control over. But 25-30 years
								ago you couldn't get an automatic camera – it was too hard. Those folk
								who were writing code were able to put pixels in specific points, and
								for us to replicate that today is difficult. Today, it's really easy to
								make text flow perfectly and expand to the screen, but what we want to
								do is make it fit into an 80-by-24-character spot and get the
								positioning absolutely right. We want the cursor to blink, we want it to
								render character by character – that kind of stuff is really hard
								now.</p>
							<p>We're in this kind of automatic, easy time, so the hard part was
								making the browser not work as well as it does today. The hard part was
								making it work as badly as it did in the olden days. Which is just
								ridiculous fun!</p>
							<p class="question">How do you feel about the result?</p>
							<p>I'm really pleased with what we've got now. There's bits that I know
								aren't perfect and I know I want to do more work on, but it's a bit like
								an artist – they see mistakes in their work but other people might not
								see that. I think what we've got creates a bit of an experience. People
								will be able to view their own homepage, and view the first website as
								well. I think it looks really good at the moment.</p>
							<p>And it was really cool to come along and be here where the web was
								created, and then come to the LHC and be amazed by wires and metal. I'm
								kind of in awe of it – it's all sinking in slowly.</p>

						<div class="qs-and-as">
							<p class="question">Why did you come to the line-mode browser hack
								days?</p>
							<p>To see CERN mostly! [laughs] I was also interested in the origins of
								the web and the line-mode browser. I'm a vintage-computing geek and
								digging into that code was a huge treat. To be able to meet some of the
								originators and be at the place where it happened is a humbling
								experience given what I do for a living.</p>

							<p class="question">What sparked your interest in vintage computers?</p>
							<p>I guess because I had some of them as a kid and now they're considered
								old. I've seen where it all started – I collect old books. There's an
								awesome bookstore in Portland called Powell's Technical Books. Well,
								nowadays you don't really need to buy a book; you can just get the
								digital edition or whatever. But if you go to Powell's there's these old
								computing textbooks that are, like, 30 years old, and you can get them
								for a buck or two. It's where it all came from.</p>
							<p>A lot of computer scientists don't realize that our craft hasn't
								changed very much. Things have gotten better, things have gotten
								prettier, but the underpinning to everything we do has been figured out
								for a very long time. Looking back we can learn about a lot of how we
								can move stuff forward.</p>

							<p class="question">Were you using the line-mode browser back in the
								day?</p>
							<p>Definitely not! My first browser was probably Mosaic. I remember when
								I first saw the web, it would have been in late 90s and I thought it
								sort of sucked. I was using BBS's back then and they had almost richer
								graphics at the time. I'm ashamed to admit it, but I remember saying to
								a friend "I just don't get it!" [laughs.]But I get it now!</p>

							<p class="question">It's day two of the hack days – what have you
								built?</p>
							<p>I paired with Remy on the server stuff. It was built in 2 days. We had
								to do a lot of basically dumbing the browser down and turn it into what
								it was like in its original form. We did a mini node module that
								stripped a lot of the browser capabilities and allowed us to proxy.
								Browsers today have a "same origin" policy so you can't just request any
								website from a website. So we circumvented the complete model of web
								security! Which may come back to bite us – hopefully not! [laughs]</p>

							<p class="question">Looking back at the old code, what were the things
								that jumped out?</p>
							<p>When we first started, we got an early copy of the original browser. I
								started to read the source and there was surprisingly little of it. And
								I found what I think could be the first declaration of a style sheet.
								The first web browser didn't have style sheets - there was a block, a
								set of structs that would denote what the indentation would be for
								different elements: like an h0, an h1 or whatever. Well, we found that
								and we couldn't believe they called it a stylesheet. This was way before
								CSS! That was one of the cool moments for sure.</p>

							<p class="question">What do you want people to take away from the
								experience of the line-mode browser?</p>
							<p>I think they should just start poking around in this old code
								themselves. Especially if you're a programmer, recognize that browsers
								since the very beginning were fundamentally open source. That's a huge
								opportunity even today. You can participate in the web in a very open
								way. Anybody can jump in and read the source, and contribute to the web
								and make it better. I think that's a powerful thing. </p>

						<div class="qs-and-as">
							<p class="question">Why did you come to the CERN line-mode browser hack
								days?</p>
							<p>I was invited to this fantastic hack event to recreate one of the very
								earliest browsers. We're creating a simulation of the experience of
								using that browser to give people who haven't used it or the old-style
								terminals a sense of what using the web was like 20 years ago. It tries
								to reproduce early web pages as authentically as possible, as well as
								taking modern pages and simulating what they would have looked like 20
								years ago.</p>

							<p class="question">How different are those two displays?</p>
							<p>In a way, they couldn't be more different. When we think of computing
								now, we think of graphical user interfaces, images – we think of drawing
								to a pixel-based high-density screen. Back then, the monitors were
								capable of drawing characters to a screen. There were no different
								fonts, no colours – not even greyscale. It was either black and white,
								or green and black. There was no mouse, no touch – in many ways you
								couldn't have a more different experience. Except maybe using punch
								cards [laughs].</p>

							<p class="question">So why go back to that?</p>
							<p>George Santayana observed:
								"Those who forget history are condemned to repeat it." It's worth
								revisiting where we've come from to firstly understand what went into
								creating earlier technologies, and also to appreciate how far we've
								come.</p>
							<p>I mean, you hear modern web developers complaining about [browser]
								compatibilities. And as someone who's been doing this for more than 20
								years – the problems that we face as developers today on the web are so
								minimal compared to the challenges we used to have, that it's good to
								remind people how good we have it these days.</p>

							<p class="question">What are you concentrating on in the next two
								days?</p>
							<p>One of the things I bring to the table is that I've probably been
								using the web as long if not longer than all the people here. I have
								first-hand experience with these sorts of devices. The web was invented
								around 1990 and became more widely used between '91 and '93. But it 1985
								I was using [computing devices such as terminals] at my first year of
								university studying computer science.</p>
							<p>Hopefully I can also bring experience of solving problems with CSS and
								JavaScript to the problems of emulating what the early web was like.</p>

							<p class="question">What do you hope people will take away from the
								experience of using the line-mode browser?</p>
							<p>Hopefully people will think a little about the longevity of the web,
								the simplicity with which it started and how it has incrementally become
								better over time. I think we can learn something from that and apply it
								to solving all kinds of complex problems.</p>
							<p>There's a term we used to use in the old days:
								"Trying to boil the ocean". You see that when people try to solve the
								entire problem rather than breaking problems into parts that each
								deliver benefits that you can iterate on. You learn as you go.</p>

							<p class="question">So iteration is important?</p>
							<p>When the web was first released, hypertext as a concept had been
								around for more than 20 years. People had built sophisticated hypertext
								systems. Tim Berners-Lee proposed a paper about the WWW for Hypertext
								'91, a conference for hypertext theory and research. It was rejected! It
								was considered very simple in comparison with what hypertext systems
								were supposed to do.</p>
							<p>There's a lesson to learn in starting simply and humbly, and iterating
								on top of that. We should be in awe of how far so many people have
								brought the web since that time. We collectively have made the web what
								it is today. It's amazing to see how far we've come.</p>
							<p>It's a bit like archaeology – we've been diving through the source
								code and finding elements. I thought I had a pretty encyclopedic
								knowledge of the web and its history. But today for example I discovered
								the &lt;HP1&gt; element in HTML – the "highlighted phrase" element –
								never heard of it! It's been fascinating to do some spelunking and
								recover some of that history. It's only been 20 years and we've almost
								forgotten it. It's about keeping the history alive.</p>

							<p class="question">Anything else you'd like to add?</p>
							<p>It's been a fantastic couple of days working with some amazing people.
								This is incredibly valuable and I look forward to people getting their
								hands on what we've done. It's all been done in the open, very much in
								the spirit of the web that we're celebrating here 20 years after the
								technology was put in the public domain. What we build is all on Github.
								I'd love people to take what we've done and continue to refine it.</p>

							<p class="question">Why did you come to the CERN line-mode browser
								development days?</p>
							<p>I'm here to help create an interface that helps people understand what
								the early web browsing experience was like.</p>

							<p class="question">Why would you want to do that?</p>
							<p>Twenty years ago, using and programming the web was a completely
								different experience from what
								it is today. Because I was using the web then, I remember what browsing
								with the line-mode browser was
								like. I remember writing code for it, and it looked a lot like the code
								we're digging through today.</p>
							<p>These days, I spend a fair amount of time teaching students and
								coaching younger web developers -- I
								love working with people who are fairly new to the web. It's important
								for aspiring web professionals
								to understand that experience and that history, in order to understand
								the web’s origins and how far we've
								gotten in a short period of time. I also think there's real value in
								understanding what mistakes were made
								in the past -- features left unfinished or functionality not clearly
								defined -- so that we don't repeat them
								in the future. </p>
							<p>This project serves as a good reminder that there are people who still
								have a text-based browsing
								experience. There are so many mobile phones that still only get a
								text-only experience, because they're
								not smart phones. And, of course, what some assistive devices render is
								more akin to a text-based experience.</p>

							<p class="question">Let's go back to that early experience of the
								text-only browser environment. What was that like when you first
								started?</p>
							<p>The first webpage that I ever made was really done with and for the
								Mosaic browser, while I was at my
								college’s computing lab. Back in my dorm room, all I had a dial-up
								connection to our Unix mail server.
								There I could only run Lynx, a text-only browser. Outside the computer
								lab, everything I did was text-only. </p>

							<p>I grew very accustomed to the difference between the two browsers. It
								forced you to think about your content as being separate from
								the presentation – it reinforced the idea that the purpose of the web
								was communicating content. A few of us who are here for the hack
								days are still evangelizing the separation of presentation from content,
								it’s that important of a concept and it’s still often ignored.</p>

							<p class="question">What are you hoping to get out of the next two
								days?</p>
							<p>I'm very interested in ensuring we can visually render a modern-day
								web page such that it looks as it would have in the old line-mode
								browser, to demonstrate that the basic instruction set of the web still
								functions today, and that we ensure it keeps on working. I’m also hoping
								to create a parser that will allow people to input a URL and get back
								code that looks like what they might have written 20 years ago: strip
								out everything modern-day and take it back to the bare bones. To say to
								developers, "No matter how beautiful you think your code is today, this
								is what
								it would have looked like 20 years ago," and hopefully pique their
								interest in understanding HTML’s origins, and the web’s origins.</p>

							<p class="question">Anything else you'd like to add?</p>
							<p>I'm so honored, and so excited, to be here. This is a complete dream!
								I have realized that not all web
								professionals know that CERN is the birthplace of the web, so I think
								we’re educating many people by being
								here. Personally, I know many people who applied to come to the hack
								days, and I realize they are living
								vicariously through me for the next couple of days, so I'm posting to
								social media as much as I can!</p>
							<p>Also, I wouldn’t be here had it not been for the encouragement and
								support of a number of
								important people from my college days. I have to thank my friend, Sarah,
								for first showing me
								how to write HTML, and I have to thank the staff at Bryn Mawr College
								(including Elysa, Helen, John,
								Rodney, David, Jeb, Alisa, and Jennifer) for giving me a running start.
								But, most of all, I have to
								thank my college advisor and friend, Deepak Kumar, who helped me find my
								first “real” web development job,
								and reinforced that what I loved doing -- creating web sites -- could
								become a viable career, before most
								people even knew what the web was.</p>

						<div class="qs-and-as">
							<p class="question">Why did you come to the CERN line-mode browser
								development days?</p>
							<p>The main reason is because I think it's important. We're highlighting
								that digital stuff can die and go away,
								and that isn't okay. The first website and the method of browsing the
								first website died 20 years ago.
								We want to make sure we can bring that back so people can see how the
								web was browsed in the days that it was
								first created. And that's pretty special I think.</p>

							<p class="question">Is there an attitude that it is okay for things to
								die online?</p>
							<p>Unfortunately there's a history of that. You remember GeoCities? Whole
								communities that have been
								there years are lost forever. Maybe it comes down to the fact that – you
								know, the content doesn't rot,
								we can't put it in a landfill. There's no material cost. It's just
								pixels, and pixels cost nothing to
								create. So people have the attitude that it doesn't matter if they
								die.</p>

							<p class="question">But surely once you have a URL it's there forever
								right?</p>
							<p>Well, that's not the case unfortunately. You can have a URL, but then
								URLs stop working. Just a few days ago quite a well-known magazine in
								the UK closed its website. All the URLS for all the articles fro the
								past 4-5 years are dead. Gone. If you wanted to find an article on that
								site now, you can't. And that's a problem. I know it takes time and
								money and effort to keep URLs alive sometimes. But some URLS should
								never have gone away. Like the first website. Because that is
								history.</p>

							<p class="question">What are you focusing on in these two days?</p>
							<p>I'm recreating the typeface. We have a test IBM terminal with the
								line-mode browser running and we've done some research into the
								typeface. We can't get it off the machine because it's probably hardware
								encoded. It's a typeface similar to Courier, but it's not Courier.</p>

							<p class="question">So the typeface is lost in the machine?</p>
							<p>Well, no. We can't quite work it out. We think the machine renders the
								typeface. It's not a file that runs on system like we use fonts now.
								It's maybe hardcoded into the display. So the computer just gives the
								display a message "display this character" and it's hardware encoded
								into the monitor to display that character.</p>

							<p>So to simulate the typeface, we've just taken really close up
								photographs of the screen and then recreated them in a bitmap format.
								There's a very limited character set – you don't really need too many
								letters.</p>

							<p class="question">What would you like people to take away from the
								experience of using the line-mode browser?</p>

							<p>I'd like people to take away how far we've come but also to take away
								an understanding of how revolutionary the web was when it first
								appeared. It was a pretty special moment when the web came about.</p>

							<p class="question">Why is the project important?</p>
							<p>The web is important in our lives today. But we seem to forget where

								bring it all together for people who never had the experience of the web
								in the first days.</p>

							<p class="question">Do you remember your first experience of using the

							<p>Yes, I remember: It was in 2001. Connectivity in Kenya is a more

								I went for classes – internet and computing classes. We visited the

								created email accounts, and some small searches. I think it was

								think the first website I used was Askjeeves.com.</p>

							<p class="question">What are you focussing on in these two days?</p>

							<p>I am on the side bringing the stories together about the first
								website, the early web and the digital
								preservation effort. It's a really big honor for me to be here – I'm a
								big fan of CERN. I've read about it
								in books and on websites. I actually participated in hackathons, Science
								hack day in Nairobi before, where
								we used the data from one of the larger experiments here at CERN: CMS.
								So it's a dream for me to be here. </p>

						<div class="qs-and-as">
							<p class="question">Why did you come to the CERN line-mode browser hack
								days?</p>
							<p>I’m absolutely fascinated by web history and where we’ve come from -
								just a huge fan of the web in general.
								So any opportunity to be involved in all those interests colliding is
								great.</p>
							<p class="question">Why is it important to preserve the first
								website?</p>
							<p>There’s something about the web that is different to other
								communication mediums that came before. The web is a very real time
								medium - we can communicate instantaneously across the world - but it
								also has this archival nature that’s built into the fact that the URLs
								are the key “killer app” of the web. Not only can you publish something
								online but by giving it an address, anyone can access it from anywhere
								in the world and theoretically, any time. So the fact that the very
								first website ever made is now accessible from its original URL over 20
								years later is kind of mind boggling.
								If you think of the way that computers generally work, that just doesn’t
								happen: CD Roms, native apps, laser discs - whatever it is, there’s a
								time period built in. They stop working, formats fade away and things
								just go away and things disappear. That does happen on the web - it
								happens a lot - but the fact that if we work at it, if we put our minds
								to it, we can preserve stuff.
								Not only is it preserved in the sense that you could look at it in the
								original browsers that were available at the time, over 20 years ago,
								but the fact that a modern browser today can still parse and render the
								first web page ever published is pretty amazing when you compare it to
								other communication tools. And the original browsers could look at a
								modern web page and it still be legible.</p>

							<p class="question">Why is it important to do this project now?</p>
							<p>I think people in some ways take the web for granted. It’s become so
								ubiquitous
								and it’s such an amazing technology that we forget to be impressed by
								it. I think people can be pretty blase about stuff disappearing online.
								I think this project is a way of calling out the fact that the first web
								page still exists and is still at the first URL is a cause for
								celebration. And you have to really work at this.</p>
							<p>Also to just show how far we’ve come - to show how the first web page
								would render on the line mode browser - to show how far we’ve come with
								our browser technology is an important point.</p>
							<p>Crucially, how much is the same. How much hasn’t changed since those
								early days.
								20 years in terms of most computing things is a ridiculously long time.
								The fact that the same formats are still being used is kind of
								unusual.</p>

							<p class="question">If we’re looking 20 years into the future, do you
								think people will still be using this line-mode browser simulator to
								look back in time?</p>
							<p>I sincerely hope that the URL that the simulator will be available at
								will still be accessible in 20 years’ time. I firmly believe people
								will still be using HTML. I don’t know about CSS or Javascript, but
								HTML will be around in 20 years. I believe that even if something
								happens to this particular instance of the simulator the fact that
								we’re going to be releasing the code and allowing people to take it and
								do what they want with it - that’s another important part of
								preservation - an important part of the web is the fact that it was
								released for free into the public domain is important.</p>
							<p>That’s the case - you’ve got liberal licensing, standardised formats
								and you’re thinking about the long term. Then year I think in 20 years
								it’ll still be available. </p>
							<p class="question">Anything else you’d like to add? </p>
							<p>Just that I’m totally geeking out here. I feel like a complete
								imposter because there are really smart people here who are talking
								about recreating entire browsers - which is so beyond my skill level.
								But I’m just very happy to be here.</p>

						<div class="qs-and-as">
							<p class="question">Why did you come to the CERN line-mode browser
								development days?</p>
							<p>Well, I see everything through the lens of publishing. The web is
								undeniably one of the most important tools democratizing our ability
								to take a piece of text — an idea — push it out there and have a
								tremendous audience with near universally accessible and relatively
								inexpensive resources on your end.</p>
							<p>If we go back to where that all began, there was, of course, Tim
								Berners-Lee and the NeXus browser but, really, the line-mode browser
								was the democratization of that first bit that they built on the NeXT
								machines.</p>
							<p>I think it's inspiring and humbling. It's fascinating to see what
								this simple, really difficult to use, command-line interface browser
								morphed into. How this thing that had such humble beginnings became
								the seed for how so much of publishing works today. The way we think
								about text — the way we think about contemporary knowledge
								dissemination — all began here with this project.</p>

							<p class="question">What do you think was the main change that the
								browser brought to the publishing world?</p>
							<p>I think it was the fact that this was a near universally accessible
								application. It was the first time that anyone who had a machine
								anywhere could download this piece of software and suddenly they
								could be publishing to a place that was theoretically accessible
								anywhere there was a computer and internet connection. And that piece
								of publishing had a real, public, open address. Obviously, 20 years
								ago the internet wasn't quite as pervasive – connections weren't
								quite as pervasive.</p>

							<p>But this is the browser that got everyone excited and helped to
								push the internet outside of academia and into our pockets all over
								the world.</p>

							<p class="question">What are you hoping to achieve in these two
								days?</p>
							<p>I'm focussing on... Honestly, I'm just geeking out. I'm just happy
								to be here. It feels like a weird Mecca of sorts to come to if you
								work with the internet, if you work with the web. Especially
								considering I owe almost all of the work I do today and that I have
								done over the last 15 years to what was created here. It's just nice
								to have that historical context and to understand the energy of the
								place where everything that we use today was born.</p>

							<p class="question">Do you remember your first experience of the
								web?</p>

							<p>Yeah. I was using Prodigy – that wasn't technically the World Wide
								Web, it was a consumer
								shell of the web. But I remember when I got my first UNIX shell
								account on a local ISP. I must have been
								14 – back in 94 or 95. Opening links using a text based browser.
								There was a moment where you could – it was
								super geeky – you could emulate a PPP socket, which allowed you on a
								Windows 95 machine to open up Mosaic, and
								using a shell account, connect to the internet, to the World Wide
								Web. </p>

							<p>I remember the first time I fired up Mosaic, I was looking at a
								web pages and I thought immediately,
								"Okay, this is worth investing in. This is worth giving my time to."

							<p class="question">Why did you come to the CERN line-mode browser

							<p>I'm here to recreate the first web pages and the early line-mode
								browser. I'm here to be part of
								something important for the web and for my profession as a web
								designer and developer. </p>

							<p class="question">Why is recreating the line-mode browser
								important?</p>

							<p>It's important to remember, to recall where we came from and to
								retrace our paths from the beginning
								right up till what the web is today. To be able to see how we
								evolved, how technology has evolved, and how
								web design has evolved with it.</p>

							<p>I think we have lost a lot of things along the way. Losing
								information is a part of the process.
								But I think that going back, as we are doing now, is like a cycle:
								we learn a lot, then we do things
								badly again, so we have to go back again to keep learning.</p>

							<p class="question">What are you hoping to achieve in the next two
								days?</p>

							<p>I really hope to build something that will let us show people –
								and not just geeks but 'normal'
								people too – that the web is really a wonderful, amazing thing. It's
								something they have to care for
								and pay attention to. People use it every day but don't pay
								attention. Just think how many people work on
								the web, and how much effort they put in.</p>

							<p class="question">What sparked your interest in the web at the
								beginning?</p>

							<p>It's so long ago that I don't remember really. I started working
								on the web in 94. I came from
								desktop publishing. In the web I found a flexible new way to create
								and produce documents and to design
								layouts. So much more flexible than having something frozen in a
								page on paper.</p>

							<p class="question">Why did you come to the CERN line-mode browser
								development days?</p>
							<p>I've been playing around with the web for the last 15-20 years.
								It's something that always fascinated me. So the opportunity to come
								to CERN to where it all started, and help document and rebuild the
								original website is a fantastic opportunity. I just had to take the
								chance to come here.</p>

							<p class="question">Why do you think we should do this project?
								What's the point?</p>
							<p>I guess, with anything – it's like archaeology. There's a lot of
								history, and we're learning from our mistakes. We run the risk of
								forgetting the things we've done before, or looking at the history
								of where we came from and how we evolved and looking at the
								decisions that were made along the way.</p>
							<p>It's like some of the things we were talking about this morning.
								It's interesting to see people fighting for “Javascript in /
								Javascript out”; “Must be pure / Must be liberal in what they
								accept.” It's been super interesting. It's a story that a lot more
								people need to know about.</p>

							<p class="question">And of course a lot of those technical arguments
								continue to this day…</p>
							<p>Absolutely. As we see with progressive enhancement, sites are very
								heavily Javascript driven with the concept of web apps. Whereas the
								thing we're building today – the original line-mode browser –
								doesn't even understand Javascript at all, so these new sites would
								fail. It's really interesting – these debates are ongoing even 20 +
								years later.</p>

							<p class="question">Are you finding it quite a technical challenge?
								What's your approach for rebuilding this simulator?</p>
							<p>That's what we're trying to figure out. It's still day one and
								we're looking at trying to have a nice balance between some
								authenticity (to make it actually as authentic as the original) but
								also keep the longevity around, so this is something that people
								will be able to run 5 or 10 years. The line mode browser is quite
								difficult to run as it is, so we want something that's going to be a
								little more future proof. That will affect how we actually build
								this. We want to try and make it as authentic an experience as it
								was 20 years ago.</p>

							<p class="question">What was your first experience of the web
								like?</p>
							<p>I use Internet Explorer 4 or 5 on a dial-up modem. I can still
								remember the beeps and whistles it made, and I was so happy when I
								upgraded it to 28.8. I had to dial up to a local service provider.
								The first time I ever discovered the web, a friend's father was
								working at a local university so he had access early on. And I was
								bitten.</p>
							<p>I always say it's a bit like photography. There's a really nice
								design aesthetic, sort of front-end development, and then there's
								really big coding side. With photography you've got the "arts" bit,
								but you also have the technical bits of the camera. The web and HTML
								is a really nice balance between both of those.</p>
